### My story
My name is Yu Gao. I am a postdoctoral researcher from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
I got my PhD in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from University of Miami in 2022. I am currently working on the SWOT data assimilation in the California Current System, with a focus on mesoscale and submesoscale processes.
