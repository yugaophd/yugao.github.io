title: About me
subtitle: Physical oceanographer, and data scientist.
---

I am a postdoctoral researcher from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I got my PhD in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from University of Miami in 2022. I am an oceanographer and data scientist with a wide range of interests, including air-sea interaction, submesoscale and mesoscale processes in the climate system, and the impact of climate change. In my past research, I have used regional coupled models, global climate models, and quantitative analysis to quantify the primary processes that drive mesoscale air-sea interaction. Currently, my project on California Current State Estimate with SWOT data assimilation aims to improve our understanding of the impact of submesoscale and mesoscale processes and their role in climate change.
