### My biograhy
My name is Yu Gao. I am a postdoctoral researcher from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
I got my PhD in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from University of Miami in 2022. I am currently working on the SWOT data assimilation in the California Current System, with a focus on mesoscale and submesoscale processes. 

### My research
With a combination of coupled modeling, observations, and quantitative analysis, my research aims to better understand a broad range of topics, including air-sea interaction, climate predictability, as well as the impact of climate change. My past research has helped to quantify the primary processes that drive the mesoscale air-sea interaction, and I have experience analyzing both regional coupled models and global climate models. With a combination of physics-based data assimilation and machine learning techiniques, my current project on California Current State Estimate with SWOT data assimilation focuses on reducing correlated errors of SWOT data and undertanding small-scale ocean processes.
