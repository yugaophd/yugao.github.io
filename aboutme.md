title: About me
subtitle: Physcial Oceanographer and Data Scientist
---

I am a postdoctoral researcher from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I got my PhD in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from University of Miami in 2022. I am an oceanographer and data scientist who's interested in a broad range of topics, including air-sea interaction, the role of submesoscale and mesoscale processes in the climate system, as well as the impact of climate change. My past research helps quantify the primary processes that drive the mesoscale air-sea interaction with regional coupled model, global climate model and quantitative analysis. With a combination of physics-based data assimilation and data-driven machine learning techiniques, my current project on California Current State Estimate with SWOT data assimilation focuses on reducing correlated errors of SWOT data and undertanding small-scale ocean processes.
