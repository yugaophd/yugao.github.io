### My biograhy
My name is Yu Gao. I am a postdoctoral researcher from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
I got my PhD in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from University of Miami in 2022. I am currently working on the SWOT data assimilation in the California Current System, with a focus on mesoscale and submesoscale processes. 

### My research
With a combination of coupled modeling, observations, and data assimilation, my research aims to understand a broad range of topics, including air-sea interaction, impact of submesoscale and mesoscale processes, climate predictibility, as well as the impact of climate change. My past research has helped to quantify the primary processes that drive the mesoscale air-sea interaction, and I have experience analyzing both regional coupled models and global climate models. With a combination of physics-based data assimilation and data-driven machine learning techiniques, my current project on California Current State Estimate with SWOT data assimilation focuses on reducing correlated errors of SWOT data and undertanding small-scale ocean processes.
