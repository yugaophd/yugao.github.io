title: About me
subtitle: Oceanographer and data scientist. I observe the ocean from space. I make waves in the comupter.

I am a postdoctoral researcher from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I got my PhD in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from University of Miami in 2022. I am an oceanographer and data scientist with a wide range of interests, including air-sea interaction, submesoscale and mesoscale processes in the climate system, and the impact of climate change. In my past research, I have used regional coupled models, global climate models, and quantitative analysis to quantify the primary processes that drive mesoscale air-sea interaction. Currently, I am working on a project that combines physics-based data assimilation and data-driven machine learning techniques to reduce correlated errors of SWOT data and understand small-scale ocean processes. Specifically, my project on California Current State Estimate with SWOT data assimilation aims to improve our understanding of the impact of submesoscale and mesoscale processes and their role in climate change.
