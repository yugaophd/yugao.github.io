<h1>Welcome to My Professional Portfolio</h1>
<p>
    I am <strong>Yu Gao</strong>, a postdoctoral researcher at the <em>Scripps Institution of Oceanography</em>. My work is an exciting blend of physical oceanography and data science. My goal is to advance our understanding of the ocean's role in climate dynamics by integrating my skills in oceanography and data science.
